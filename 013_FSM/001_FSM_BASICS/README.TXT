Refer results folder. Refer the state diagram of both.

So, the output must generate at state 2 in both cases. As per our state diagram.

In Mealy Machine,	*the output must be generated at 2nd state* 
			i.e. after receiving the PRESENT STATE and PRESENT OUTPUT,
			
			In, Mealy 3,2 Method, Output Generates at State 1. (Not Recommended.) 
			
			In, Moore 1 Method, Output Generates at State 2. (Recommended.) 						
			
			Hence, 1-PROCESS METHODOLOGY is suitable for Mealy Machine.



In Moore Machine,	the output must be generated at 2nd state 
			i.e. after receiving the PRESENT STATE,
			
			In, Mealy 3,2 Method, Output Generates at State 2. (Recommended.) 
			
			In, Moore 1 Method, Output Generates at State 1. (Not-Recommended.) 						
			
			Hence, 3,2 PROCESS METHODOLOGY is suitable for Moore Machine.


Asynchronus and Synchronus Systems:

Refer the IMP diagrams. 

The system must wait for the next clock cycle for state change.
